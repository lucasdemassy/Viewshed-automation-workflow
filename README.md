This repository contains multiple python scripts in order to automatize viewsheds creation from buildings thanks to a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) and a vector layer (point or polygon) of these buildings. 
The workflow is divided in several steps :
1. Observation points calculation
2. (optional) GRASS files management
3. (optional) Organizing viewshed files
4. QGIS plugin for viewshed visualization
5. (optional) Analysing statisticly viewsheds

A majority of scripts require QGIS or GRASS GIS, both available at this link : https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

This work has been achieved during an internship summer at the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC-SAZU). The observation points creation process is designed for buildings in mind. It can be adjusted for other purposes.
