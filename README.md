This repository contains multiple python scripts in order to automatize viewsheds creation from buildings thanks to a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) and a vector layer (point or polygon) of these buildings. 
The workflow is divided in several steps :
1. Observation points calculation
2. (optional) GRASS files management
3. (optional) Organizing viewshed files
4. QGIS plugin for viewshed visualization
5. (optional) Analysing statisticly viewsheds

A majority of scripts require QGIS or GRASS GIS, both available at this link : https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

This work has been achieved during an internship summer at the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC-SAZU). The observation points creation process is designed for buildings in mind. It can be adjusted for other purposes.

All the documentation is in the PDF, it contains futher explanation about how to use scripts, how they work, and the overall viewshed analysis made for the ZRC-SAZU on the area around a Mayan city.
